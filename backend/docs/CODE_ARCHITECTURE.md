## Architecture Overview

Chat Hive follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture pattern:

- **Models**: Define the data structure and database interactions
- **Controllers**: Handle the business logic and request processing
- **Routes**: Define the API endpoints and connect them to controllers

The frontend serves as the View layer, consuming the API provided by the backend.

## Key Components

### Models

The application uses Mongoose schemas to define the data structure:

1. **User Model**: Represents application users with authentication details
2. **Chat Model**: Represents a conversation between users
3. **Message Model**: Represents individual messages within a chat
4. **User Model**: Represents user

### Controllers

Controllers handle the business logic:

1. **Chat Controller**: Manages chat creation, deletion, and retrieval
2. **Message Controller**: Handles message creation and deletion
3. **Health Check Controller**: Provides API status information
4. **User Controller**: Manages user related work.

### Utilities

1. **ApiResponse**: Standardizes API responses
2. **AsyncHandler**: Wraps async functions to handle errors
3. **Cloudinary**: Manages image uploads

## Data Flow

1. Client sends a request to an API endpoint
2. The request is routed to the appropriate controller
3. The controller processes the request, interacts with models as needed
4. The controller returns a standardized response

## Authentication Flow

Authentication is handled through Clerk:

## Real-time Communication

Real-time messaging is implemented using Socket.io:

## Error Handling

The application uses a centralized error handling approach:

1. AsyncHandler catches errors in async functions
2. Standardized error responses are returned to the client
3. Errors are logged using Winston

## Future Improvements
